# Realtime

[Realtime APIs](https://docs.cortex.dev/workloads/realtime) respond to requests synchronously and autoscale based on in-flight request volumes. Realtime APIs are a good fit for users who want to run stateless containers as a scalable microservice (for example, deploying machine learning models as APIs).

Key features

- respond to requests synchronously
- autoscale based on request volume
- avoid cold starts
- scale to zero
- perform rolling updates
- automatically recover from failures and spot instance termination
- perform A/B tests and canary deployments

### Run

Locally

Test the sentiment classifier model

```bash
docker build -t sentiment -f project/sentiment/Dockerfile.sentiment project/sentiment/
docker run --rm -it sentiment
```

Build a docker image and test the application

```bash
docker build -t sentiment .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e ENABLE_METRICS=true sentiment
```

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:8000/classify?input_text=i%20like%20you' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -d ''
```

Realtime API [handles and routes requests](https://docs.cortex.dev/workloads/realtime/containers#handling-requests) to subpaths. Subpaths are supported; for example, if your API is named hello-world, a request to `<load_balancer_url>/hello-world` will be routed to the root (`/`) of your web server, and a request to `<load_balancer_url>/hello-world/subpatch` will be routed to `/subpath` on your web server.

Run tests using pytest (Replace line number 5 and 7 in `project/Dockerfile` with `requirements-test.txt` instead of `requirements.txt`)

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -it -v $(pwd):/app --entrypoint bash -e ENABLE_METRICS=true sentiment
pytest --cov
```

Push the docker image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
docker build -t <docker-username>/sentiment:0.1 .
docker push <docker-username>/sentiment:0.1
```

Configure a Cortex deployment (using the configuration above create `cortex.yaml`).

```yaml

```

Pre-requisities

- AWS cli
- Create an IAM user with AdministratorAccess and programmatic access.

### Cortex Deployment

- Create a cluster on AWS Account using `cluster.yaml` configuration.

  ```bash
  cortex cluster up cluster.yaml --configure-env prod
  ```

- Create a Cortex deployment on above created cluster

  ```bash
  cortex deploy --env prod
  ```

- Wait for API to be ready

  ```bash
  cortex get --watch
  ```

- Get API endpoint

  ```bash
  cortex get <name-of-API>           # in this case sentiment
  cortex describe <name-of-API>      # in this case sentiment
  ```

- Logs of API

  ```bash
  cortex logs <name-of-API>          # in this case sentiment
  ```

  Here there will be a metrics dashboard and endpoint url with prometheus and grafana integrated by default (how cool is that). Definitions of different metrics on dashboard: [metrics](https://docs.cortex.dev/workloads/realtime/metrics#metrics-in-the-dashboard)

- Test the endpoint

  ```bash
  curl -i -X POST \
    '<endpoint>/classify?input_text=i%20like%20you' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -d ''
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  python3 sync_requests.py
  python3 async_requests.py
  ```

- Delete the API

  ```bash
  cortex delete <name-of-API>         # in this case sentiment
  ```

- Delete the cluster on AWS

  The contents of Cortex's S3 bucket, the EBS volumes (used by Cortex's Prometheus and Grafana instances), and the log group are deleted by default when running `cortex cluster down`.

  ```bash
  cortex cluster down
  ```

Additional Configuration

It is also possible to connect cortex deployment with [kubectl](https://docs.cortex.dev/clusters/advanced/kubectl#update-kubeconfig) to access pods, deployment and services related to the application.
